# Contributing Guidelines

We welcome pull requests that improve the project. When submitting changes,
please ensure your commit messages succinctly describe the modifications.

## Commit summaries

- Begin the summary with an imperative verb (e.g. "add", "update", "fix").
- Mention the specific scripts or documentation affected.
- Keep the summary under 72 characters when possible.
- Include a body if further explanation is helpful.

Clear summaries help future maintainers understand the history of the codebase.
